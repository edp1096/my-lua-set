Scripts for portable Lua working set creation on Windows

## Installation
```powershell
.\install_all.ps1
```
* Trouble shooting - `ExecutionPolicy` should be set to `RemoteSigned` and unblock `ps1` files
    ```powershell
    ExecutionPolicy                                     # Check
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned # Set as RemoteSigned
    Unblock-File *.ps1                                  # Unblock ps1 files
    ```

## Run
